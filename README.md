## Usage

All solutions are in the [Solutions](Solutions) folder.

In LeetCode, the structure of the problem link is as follows: https://leetcode.com/problems/{Problem-Name}

We keep all problem solutions in a folder called `Problem-Name`. For example, the solutions
to [this problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) with name `two-sum` are located in folder `two-sum`
inside [Solutions](Solutions/two-sum) folder.

Every problem can be solved with different languages. For example, `C#`, `Python`, etc. To separate the languages, we
save each language in a folder with its own name. For example, for `C#`, the solution is placed in a folder
called `csharp`.

For example, the tree structure of a solutions can look like this:

- Solutions
    - [two-sum](https://github.com/HamidMolareza/LeetCode/tree/master/Solutions/two-sum)
        - README.md (the question text)
        - csharp
          - Solution
            - program.cs
          - Test
          - README (about solutions)
        - python
          - program.py
    - [combine-two-tables](https://github.com/HamidMolareza/LeetCode/tree/master/Solutions/combine-two-tables/MySQL)
      - README.md (the question text)
      - MySQL
        - solution.sql
        - README.md (about solution)

## Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! Contributions make the free/open-source community such an
amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will benefit everybody else and are **greatly

## Authors & contributors

## About Readme.md

This file is generated [automatically](.github/workflows/update-readme.yml). You can see the source of this program in
the [Readme Generator](ReadmeGenerator) directory.

This project uses [the Payadel README template](https://github.com/Payadel/Readme/).

### Why readme is auto-generated?

I didn't want to manually update the table in this file every time a problem was solved. This is repetitive work and
programmers hate repetitive work!

### How does readme generated?

In summary, the list of problems and solutions is read from the [Solutions](Solutions) folder, and the processed
information is placed in [this format](ReadmeGenerator/Data/ReadmeTemplate.md).
For more information please see [Readme Generator](ReadmeGenerator).
