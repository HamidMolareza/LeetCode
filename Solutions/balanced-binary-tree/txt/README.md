# Intuition
To determine if a binary tree is balanced, we need to ensure that for every node, the height difference between its left and right subtrees is no more than one. A balanced tree will allow us to recursively verify that this condition holds true at each subtree.

# Approach
We can use a depth-first search (DFS) to check the balance and calculate the height of each subtree in a single traversal. Starting from the root, for each node:
1. Recursively compute the height of the left and right subtrees.
2. If either subtree is unbalanced, propagate a failure up the recursion stack.
3. If both subtrees are balanced, check the height difference between them:
   - If the difference is greater than 1, the tree is unbalanced.
   - Otherwise, the tree remains balanced, and we compute the node's height as `1 + max(left height, right height)`.

Using this approach, we can identify if the tree is balanced while minimizing redundant height calculations by storing and reusing subtree heights.

# Complexity
- **Time complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes. Each node is visited once.
- **Space complexity**: `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack, which can be `O(log n)` for a balanced tree or `O(n)` for an unbalanced tree.

# Other Solutions
1. **Top-Down Approach**: In this approach, we calculate the height of each subtree multiple times, which leads to an `O(n^2)` time complexity. Although simpler, it is inefficient for large trees, making it less optimal than the DFS approach that calculates each subtree height once.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We could use BFS to check if the tree is balanced level by level. However, BFS would require additional space for a queue to store nodes at each level and may not offer a time advantage.
