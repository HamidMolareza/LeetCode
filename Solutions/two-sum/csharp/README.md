# Intuition
The problem asks for two numbers from the given array that add up to a specific target. My first thought is to efficiently track the numbers we have seen so far, so we can quickly find the pair that sums up to the target.

# Approach
We can use a **hash map** (dictionary) to store the complement of the current number (i.e., `target - nums[i]`). As we iterate through the array, for each element, we check if the complement already exists in the hash map. If it does, we have found the pair. If not, we add the current element to the map and continue.

This approach ensures that we only traverse the array once, making it more efficient than a brute-force solution.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  `O(n)` - We traverse the array once, and each lookup or insertion in the hash map takes `O(1)` time.

- Space complexity:  
  `O(n)` - In the worst case, we store all elements in the hash map.

# Other Solutions
A **brute-force** solution would involve two nested loops, checking all pairs of numbers to see if their sum equals the target. However, this has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` and is not suitable for large input sizes, making it less efficient.
