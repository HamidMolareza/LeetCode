# Intuition
The problem requires merging two sorted arrays, where one of the arrays has enough space to accommodate the other. Since both arrays are already sorted, we can leverage this property by merging them from the end to avoid shifting elements repeatedly.

# Approach
1. Start from the end of both arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`), and compare the elements.
2. Place the larger element at the end of `nums1` (where extra space is available).
3. Continue this process until one of the arrays is exhausted.
4. If there are any remaining elements in `nums2`, copy them to the front of `nums1`.
5. There is no need to copy elements from `nums1` since they are already in place.

This approach efficiently merges both arrays in-place without using extra space.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  `O(m + n)` - We traverse both arrays once, where `m` and `n` are the sizes of `nums1` and `nums2`.

- Space complexity:  
  `O(1)` - The merging is done in-place without using additional space.

# Other Solutions
Another solution could involve copying elements to a new array and sorting it. However, this would require extra space and be less efficient with a time complexity of `O((m + n) log (m + n))`. Thus, the in-place merging approach is preferred for both performance and space efficiency.
