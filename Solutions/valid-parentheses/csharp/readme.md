# Intuition
The problem requires checking if a string of parentheses is valid, meaning every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. My first thought is to use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets as we encounter them.

# Approach
1. Create a stack to store opening brackets.
2. Iterate through each character in the string:
   - If it's an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, or `[`), push it onto the stack.
   - If it's a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, or `]`):
     - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, return `false` (no matching opening bracket).
     - Otherwise, pop the top of the stack and check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket. If it doesn't match, return `false`.
3. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, all brackets were matched correctly, so return `true`. If not, return `false`.

This approach efficiently ensures that all brackets are correctly paired and ordered.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  `O(n)` - We traverse the string once, where `n` is the length of the string.

- Space complexity:  
  `O(n)` - In the worst case, we may need to store all opening brackets in the stack.

# Other Solutions
An alternative solution could involve using a counter for each type of bracket, but this would require careful tracking of counts and wouldnâ€™t be as clean or efficient as the stack approach. Another approach would be to use a mapping of closing brackets to opening ones, but it essentially functions similarly to the stack method.
