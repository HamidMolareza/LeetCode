# Intuition
The problem requires finding the length of the last word in a given string. My first thought is to trim any trailing spaces and then find the last space in the string to determine the length of the last word.

# Approach
1. First, we trim any whitespace from both ends of the string to handle trailing spaces.
2. Next, we find the last space character in the trimmed string.
3. If a space is found, the length of the last word is the difference between the total length of the string and the index of the last space. If no space is found, the entire string is the last word.

This approach efficiently isolates the last word and calculates its length.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  `O(n)` - We may traverse the string to trim spaces and find the last space, where `n` is the length of the string.

- Space complexity:  
  `O(1)` - We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

# Other Solutions
Another solution could involve splitting the string by spaces and checking the last element of the resulting array. However, this may require more memory for the array and can be less efficient due to the splitting process.
