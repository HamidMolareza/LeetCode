# Intuition

The problem requires finding the longest common prefix among an array of strings. A good way to approach this is to look for the shortest prefix shared by all the strings. If at any point two strings differ, the common prefix ends there. An optimal way is to start by comparing characters from the beginning until the characters don’t match.

# Approach

1. **Edge Case:** If the list is empty, return an empty string.
2. Start with the first string as the prefix and compare it with each subsequent string in the list.
3. For each comparison, shorten the prefix until it matches the beginning of the current string.
4. If the prefix becomes empty at any point, return an empty string immediately.
5. At the end, the prefix will contain the longest common prefix among all the strings.

This approach works efficiently by minimizing unnecessary comparisons.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  `O(n * m)` – where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the length of the shortest string. In the worst case, we compare each character of every string.

- Space complexity:  
  `O(1)` – We only use a few extra variables for tracking the prefix.

# Other Solutions

- **Divide-and-Conquer:** Split the list into halves recursively and find the common prefix for each half. While this solution is elegant, it introduces overhead due to recursion.
- **Vertical Scanning:** Compare characters column-wise for all strings. While it works well, it may involve more comparisons than the horizontal scanning method used here.

# Pseudo Code

1. If the input list is empty, return an empty string.
2. Set the first string as the initial `prefix`.
3. Iterate through the rest of the strings:
   - While the current string does not start with `prefix`:
     - Remove the last character from `prefix`.
     - If `prefix` becomes empty, return an empty string.
4. After checking all strings, return the `prefix`.
