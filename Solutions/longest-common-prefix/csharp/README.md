# Intuition

The problem asks for the longest common prefix among an array of strings. My first thought is to compare characters across all strings to find the longest matching sequence from the beginning. If we encounter a mismatch, we stop and return the prefix found so far.

# Approach

1. If the input array is empty, return an empty string.
2. Take the first string as the reference prefix.
3. Iterate over the other strings and reduce the prefix length until it matches the beginning of each string.
4. If at any point the prefix becomes empty, return an empty string.

This approach ensures we only compare as much as necessary to find the common prefix.

# Complexity

- Time complexity:  
  `O(n * m)` - `n` is the number of strings, and `m` is the length of the shortest string. In the worst case, we may compare all characters of all strings.

- Space complexity:  
  `O(1)` - We use a constant amount of extra space for the prefix.

# Other Solutions

A horizontal scanning approach compares strings one by one. Another approach is **divide-and-conquer**, which recursively divides the input into two halves to find the prefix. A **binary search** on the prefix length is also possible, but these approaches are more complex without significant performance benefits for small inputs.

# Code

```csharp
public class Solution {
    public string LongestCommonPrefix(string[] strs) {
        if (strs == null || strs.Length == 0) return "";

        string prefix = strs[0]; // Take the first string as the initial prefix

        for (int i = 1; i < strs.Length; i++) {
            while (strs[i].IndexOf(prefix) != 0) {
                prefix = prefix.Substring(0, prefix.Length - 1); // Shorten the prefix
                if (prefix == "") return "";
            }
        }

        return prefix;
    }
}
```
