# Intuition
This problem is a classic dynamic programming problem. The idea is that to reach a certain step, you could have come from either the previous step or the step before that. This is analogous to calculating the Fibonacci sequence.

# Approach
1. If there are 0 or 1 steps, the answer is 1 (since there's only one way to stay at the ground level or take the first step).
2. Use a dynamic programming approach to build the solution iteratively:
   - Start by initializing the ways to reach the first two steps.
   - For each subsequent step, the number of ways to get there is the sum of the ways to reach the two previous steps.
3. This can be done with a bottom-up approach to avoid recursion and stack overflow issues.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:  
  `O(n)` - We iterate once through the steps.

- Space complexity:  
  `O(1)` - We use a constant amount of space to store the last two values.

# Other Solutions
A recursive solution with memoization could also solve the problem, but it may require more memory. A purely recursive solution without memoization is easy to understand but inefficient (`O(2^n)` time complexity). Thus, the iterative approach is preferred for optimal performance.
